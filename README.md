## CARTMINER

It's a simple cart bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) made as a code testing for Codeminer.

It uses Jest for testing and redux for state management.

It's hosted with Netlify's help at [relaxed-swirles-0dd249.netflify.com](relaxed-swirles-0dd249.netflify.com)

Useful scripts:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

### `yarn eject`

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
